# VFI-CVD

Code relaese for *Describing Visual Attributes with Pre-trained Image Encoder for Few-shot Fine-grained Recognition*.

## Overall Framework

![./Figure/overall framework.jpg](https://github.com/348632874/VFI-CVD/blob/main/Figure/Overall%20Framework.jpg)

A Variational Feature Imitation method Conditioned on Visual Descriptions, namely VFI-CVD, is proposed, which integrates the pre-trained knowledge from a vision foundation model and the expert knowledge captured via a feature extractor, thus generating representations with adequate generalization and fine-grained discrimination capability.

## Code Environment

* You can create a conda environment with the correct dependencies using the following command lines:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate VFI-CVD
```

* The vision foundation model CLIP \[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020), [Code](https://github.com/openai/CLIP)\] is installed as:

```
$ pip install ftfy regex tqdm
$ pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
```

## Dataset

Thanks to the contribution of [BiFRN](https://github.com/PRIS-CV/Bi-FRN), the code is implemeted based on it with the processed few-shot fine-grained recognition datasets: [CUB-200-2011](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WxDB3g3U_SrF2sv-DmFYl8LS0p_wAowh/view), [Stanford Cars](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ImEPQH5gHpSE_Mlq8bRvxxcUXOwdHIeF/view?usp=drive_link), [Stanford Dogs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13avzK22oatJmtuyK0LlShWli00NsF6N0/view?usp=drive_link). In addition, we perform experiments on the challenging benchmark dataset iNaturalist2017 \[[Data](https://ml-inat-competition-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/train_val_images.tar.gz), [Annotation](https://ml-inat-competition-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/train_2017_bboxes.zip)\]. The iNaturalist is processed into the few-shot version by `./data/init_meta_iNat.py`, which follows the usage in [FRN](https://github.com/Tsingularity/FRN). The closed_set studies are conducted on the data processed by `./data/closed_set.py`.

## Train

* To train VFI-CVD on `CUB_fewshot_cropped` with Conv-4 backbone under the 1/5-shot setting, run the following command lines:

```
cd experiments/CUB_fewshot_cropped/CVF/Conv-4
./train.sh
```

## Test

```
cd experiments/CUB_fewshot_cropped/CVF/Conv-4
python ./test.py
```
